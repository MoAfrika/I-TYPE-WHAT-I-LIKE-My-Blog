                        <p>On May 24th this year, I lost my mom to cancer. The world felt heavy, like someone hit the mute button on my life’s playlist. We laid her to rest on June 1st, a day that marked the end of her earthly reign and the start of my internal monologue about all those wild dreams she might’ve put on hold.</p>

                            each of us a bit rough around the edges, but sparkling with potential.

                        <p>But soon after she transitioned, chaos reigned. It’s like the universe said, “Hey, let’s turn this grief into family drama!” Suddenly, my siblings and I were at each other's throats like contestants on a reality show. We used to be tight—oh, how naive I was. Now? We’re dodging each other like we’re in a game of emotional dodgeball. I relapsed back to weed after a year of being clean. Who knew grief could feel so cozy?</p>
                        
                        <h2 class="section-heading">What Would Mama Do?</h2>
                        <p>In moments of confusion, I often ask, "What would Mama do?" She had this magic touch for finding the light in dark times, showing us that even when life throws curveballs, there's always a way to hit it out of the park. Now I’m trying to channel her spirit because her dreams? They live on through us. We are her legacy, and it’s our duty to chase our aspirations with that same fire.</p>
                        
                        <p>As part of continuing her legacy, I’m excited to announce that I’m starting a nonprofit organization in her memory to carry on her work and uplift others just as she did.</p>
                        
                        <p>Seriously though, it’s wild how life flipped upside down after we buried her. It was like everyone turned their pain into weapons. “Oh, you’re hurting? Let me hit you with my own pain!” Family gatherings felt more like battlegrounds than safe spaces. Going home? Nah, I’d rather binge-watch the latest series. That house is now a shrine to her absence, echoing with memories that make me feel like a ghost wandering through someone else’s life.</p>
                        
                        <blockquote class="blockquote">“The dreams of yesterday are now the tears of today and the confusion of tomorrow.”</blockquote>
                        
                        <p>But hey, I’m determined to keep her dreams alive. I’m diving into her aspirations like they’re a fresh beat ready to drop. Every step I take, I’m carrying her lessons close, striving to be the person she always believed I could be. Her love? Unconditional, and it fuels my journey like a fire under my feet.</p>
                        
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Continuing Her Legacy</h2>
                        <p>While she may not be here in the physical sense, I know she’s vibing with me in spirit, whispering wisdom as I navigate this maze called life. I hold onto the hope that she’s watching over us, urging us to chase our dreams and love each other fiercely.</p>
                        
                        <p>This isn’t just a farewell; it’s a celebration of a life well-lived, full of laughter, lessons, and love. So here’s to you, Mom—thank you for everything, even when life gets messy. I’ll keep rocking this journey, one puff, one laugh, and one dream at a time.</p>
